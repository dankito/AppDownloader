Due to privacy issues I wanted to get rid of Google Play Services.

As replacement for the Play Store App I created this AppDownloader which searches for Apps on the HTML version of Play Store and downloads an App from different independent resources (like [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) and [ApkMirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/)).
